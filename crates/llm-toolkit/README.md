# llm-toolkit
Basic llm tools for rust

# Motivation & Philosophy

High-level LLM frameworks like LangChain, while powerful, can be problematic in Rust. Their heavy abstractions and complex type systems often conflict with Rust's strengths, imposing significant constraints and learning curves on developers.

There is a clear need for a different kind of tool: a low-level, unopinionated, and minimalist toolkit that provides robust "last mile" utilities for LLM integration, much like how `candle` provides core building blocks for ML without dictating the entire application architecture.

This document proposes the creation of `llm-toolkit`, a new library crate designed to be the professional's choice for building reliable, high-performance LLM-powered applications in Rust.

## Core Design Principles

1.  **Minimalist & Unopinionated:**
    The toolkit will NOT impose any specific application architecture. Developers are free to design their own `UseCase`s and `Service`s. `llm-toolkit` simply provides a set of sharp, reliable "tools" to be called when needed.

2.  **Focused on the "Last Mile Problem":**
    The toolkit focuses on solving the most common and frustrating problems that occur at the boundary between a strongly-typed Rust application and the unstructured, often unpredictable string-based responses from LLM APIs.

3.  **Minimal Dependencies:**
    The toolkit will have minimal dependencies (primarily `serde` and `minijinja`) to ensure it can be added to any Rust project with negligible overhead and maximum compatibility.

## Features

| Feature Area | Description | Key Components | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Content Extraction** | Safely extracting structured data (like JSON) from unstructured LLM responses. | `extract` module (`FlexibleExtractor`, `extract_json`) | Implemented |
| **Prompt Generation** | Building complex prompts from Rust data structures with a powerful templating engine. | `prompt!` macro, `#[derive(ToPrompt)]` | Implemented |
| **Intent Extraction** | Extracting structured intents (e.g., enums) from LLM responses. | `intent` module (`IntentExtractor`, `PromptBasedExtractor`) | Implemented |
| **Resilient Deserialization** | Deserializing LLM responses into Rust types, handling schema variations. | (Planned) | Planned |

## Prompt Generation

`llm-toolkit` offers two powerful and convenient ways to generate prompts, powered by the `minijinja` templating engine.

### 1. Ad-hoc Prompts with `prompt!` macro

For quick prototyping and flexible prompt creation, the `prompt!` macro provides a `println!`-like experience. You can pass any `serde::Serialize`-able data as context.

```rust
use llm_toolkit::prompt::prompt;
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct User {
    name: &'static str,
    role: &'static str,
}

let user = User { name: "Mai", role: "UX Engineer" };
let task = "designing a new macro";

let p = prompt!(
    "User {{user.name}} ({{user.role}}) is currently {{task}}.",
    user = user,
    task = task
).unwrap();

assert_eq!(p, "User Mai (UX Engineer) is currently designing a new macro.");
```

### 2. Structured Prompts with `#[derive(ToPrompt)]`

For core application logic, you can derive the `ToPrompt` trait on your structs to generate prompts in a type-safe way.

**Setup:**

First, enable the `derive` feature in your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
llm-toolkit = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
```

**Usage:**

Then, use the `#[derive(ToPrompt)]` and `#[prompt(...)]` attributes on your struct. The struct must also derive `serde::Serialize`.

```rust
use llm_toolkit::ToPrompt;
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(ToPrompt, Serialize)]
#[prompt(template = "USER PROFILE:\nName: {{name}}\nRole: {{role}}")]
struct UserProfile {
    name: &'static str,
    role: &'static str,
}

let user = UserProfile {
    name: "Yui",
    role: "World-Class Pro Engineer",
};

let p = user.to_prompt();
// The following would be printed:
// USER PROFILE:
// Name: Yui
// Role: World-Class Pro Engineer
```

### 3. Enum Documentation with `#[derive(ToPrompt)]`

For enums, the `ToPrompt` derive macro automatically generates prompts from doc comments, making it easy to document your enum variants for LLM consumption:

```rust
use llm_toolkit::ToPrompt;

/// Represents different user intents for a chatbot
#[derive(ToPrompt)]
pub enum UserIntent {
    /// User wants to greet or say hello
    Greeting,
    /// User is asking for help or assistance
    Help,
    /// User wants to know the current weather
    WeatherQuery,
    /// User wants to set a reminder for later
    SetReminder,
    /// User is saying goodbye
    Farewell,
}

let intent = UserIntent::Greeting;
let p = intent.to_prompt();
// The following would be printed:
// UserIntent: Represents different user intents for a chatbot
//
// Possible values:
// - Greeting: User wants to greet or say hello
// - Help: User is asking for help or assistance
// - WeatherQuery: User wants to know the current weather
// - SetReminder: User wants to set a reminder for later
// - Farewell: User is saying goodbye
```

## Future Directions

### Image Handling Abstraction
A planned feature is to introduce a unified interface for handling image inputs across different LLM providers. This would abstract away the complexities of dealing with various data formats (e.g., Base64, URLs, local file paths) and model-specific requirements, providing a simple and consistent API for multimodal applications.
